# Weather-Dashboard

I create a weather dashboard that will present the user with todays current weather data and then a future five day forecast. 

To use the dashboard type the name of a city in the search box. As you search the city will be saved to a list allowing you to select them again for viewing.   

Below is a screen shot of the weather dashboard:
